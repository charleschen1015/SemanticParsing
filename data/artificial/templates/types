### Enter a type 'identifier' and its actual 'representation'. The interpreter will recursively replace
### any occurrence of the 'identifier' with its 'representation' in a template.
###


### A few rules:
### - Any non-empty line other than comments must contain a type.
### - Do not use special symbols and names in identifiers. For a list of such symbols see README.
### - In case of redefinition, the latest definition will be used.
### - Each identifier should be on one line only.
### - If one identifier is for the logical names of corresponding to another identifier, add a '_logic' suffix to it.
###   Keep in mind that they must contain exactly the same number of options as each other.
